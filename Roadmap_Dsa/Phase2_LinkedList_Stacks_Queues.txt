🧱 Phase 2: Linear Data Structures – Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
🔍 Why This Next
These structures extend arrays with dynamic memory and specific behaviors:

LIFO for stacks
FIFO for queues

📘 Key Topics
🔗 Linked Lists: Singly, doubly, circular; operations like reversal, cycle detection

🧮 Stacks: Implementation, applications (e.g., expression evaluation)

🧺 Queues: Implementation, priority queues (basic intro)

🧠 Essential Techniques
🐢🐇 Slow and fast pointers (e.g., cycle detection)

📈 Monotonic stacks (e.g., next greater element)

🎢 Deque for sliding window maximum

🧩 Example Problems
🔄 Reverse a Linked List

✅ Valid Parentheses (stacks)

🔁 Implement Queue Using Stacks

💡 Practice Tip
Understand how these differ from arrays

Focus on their real-world applications
