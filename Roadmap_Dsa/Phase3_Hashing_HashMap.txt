🗃️ Phase 3: Hashing and Hashmaps
🔍 Why This Next
Hashmaps provide fast lookups (O(1) average time)
Extremely useful for optimization

📘 Key Topics
🧠 Hashmaps: Operations, handling collisions
🚫 Sets: Uniqueness checks
🧮 Applications: Counting frequencies, subarray problems, grouping

🧠 Essential Techniques
🧩 Two-sum variations
➕ Longest subarray with sum K
🔤 Grouping anagrams

🧩 Example Problems
✅ Two Sum
🔢 Longest Consecutive Sequence
➗ Subarray Sum Equals K

💡 Practice Tip
Use hashmaps to optimize brute-force solutions
