📘 Main List – Topics to Learn (Phase 1: Arrays, Strings, Sorting)
🅰️ Arrays
🔧 Basic Operations
🔹 Accessing elements

🔹 Insertion & Deletion (at beginning, middle, end)

🔹 Traversal techniques:

🔸 for loop

🔸 while loop

🔸 Enhanced/for-each loop

🧮 Multi-Dimensional Arrays
🔹 2D Arrays / Matrix Representation

🔄 Rotation and Rearrangement
🔹 Array rotation (left/right by k steps)

🔹 Merging two sorted arrays

🔹 Rearranging elements:

➕/➖ Positive and Negative

🔢 Even and Odd

0️⃣ and 1️⃣ segregation

📈 Searching and Analysis
🔹 Finding max/min elements

🔹 Finding duplicates in an array

🔹 Searching in:

🔸 Unsorted arrays

🔸 Sorted arrays

💡 Algorithmic Techniques
🔹 Kadane’s Algorithm (Maximum subarray sum)

🔹 Prefix Sum Array (for range sum queries)

🔹 Two-pointer Technique (e.g., reversing, triplets)

🔹 Sliding Window Technique (fixed/variable size problems)

🔍 Binary Search
(Often considered a sub-topic of arrays but listed separately for clarity)

🧠 Classic + Variations
🔹 Classic Binary Search

🔹 First and Last Occurrence

🔹 Search in Rotated Sorted Array

🔹 Lower Bound / Upper Bound concepts

🔹 Binary Search on Answers (Advanced)

📚 Problems Requiring Sorting + Searching
🔹 Triplet Sum / 3Sum Problem

🔹 Merge Intervals

🅱️ Strings
✂️ Basic String Handling
🔹 Accessing characters

🔹 Getting string length

🔹 String concatenation and splitting

🧠 Analysis and Frequency
🔹 Character frequency count (using array/hashmap)

🔹 String immutability (and how to work around it)

🔹 String compression problems

🔄 Transformations
🔹 Reversing a string (with and without temp vars)

🔹 String to Integer conversion (atoi() logic)

🔹 String rotation and checking for rotated versions

🔍 Pattern Matching & Special Problems
🔹 Substrings and subsequences

🔹 Palindrome checks (2-pointer)

🔹 Anagram detection

🔹 Longest Common Prefix

🔹 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window)

🔹 Pattern matching:

🔸 Naive Approach

🔸 KMP Algorithm (Optional but powerful)

🔢 Sorting Algorithms
🧪 Basic Sorting
🔹 Bubble Sort 💬 (understand and implement manually)

🔹 Insertion Sort

🔹 Selection Sort (optional)

⚙️ Efficient Sorting
🔹 Merge Sort ✅ (must-learn)

🔹 Quick Sort ✅ (must-learn)

🔹 Heap Sort (usually covered again in Heap phase)

📊 Advanced/Extra Sorting

🔹 Stable vs Unstable Sorting

🔎 Searching Algorithms
📌 Essentials
🔹 Linear Search

🔹 Binary Search (already covered under Arrays section)
